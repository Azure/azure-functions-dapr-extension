## Unable to find package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr with version 99.99.99

**Symptoms:** When building the Azure Function Dapr Extension [dotnet-isolated sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/dotnet-isolated-azurefunction), you encounter an issue where it looks for the package `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr` with version (>= 99.99.99), which is not available in the global NuGet package.

```
== APP == /WorkerExtensions.csproj : error NU1102: Unable to find package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr with version (>= 99.99.99)
== APP == WorkerExtensions.csproj : error NU1102:   - Found 4 version(s) in nuget.org [ Nearest version: 0.17.0-preview01 ]
```

**Possible Causes:** The issue is caused by the dotnet language worker adding a reference to the NuGet package `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr` with an a version (99.99.99) in `WorkerExtensions.csproj`. Once package reference is added to `WorkerExtensions.csproj`, it always looks for above nuget package even though you are not referencing it in you dotnet-isolate azure function. This is a [known issue in dotnet-language worker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/issues/550) and should be fixed as part of [this PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/pull/1749).

**Resolution:**

1. ***Generate the Package:***

   Build the Azure Function Dapr Extension repository from the root directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet build --configfile nuget.config
   ```
   This build step will create an `local-packages` folder in the root directory.
2. ***Modify Global NuGet Configuration:***

    Next, you need to modify the global NuGet configuration file, which can be found at the following location based on your operating system:

    Windows: ```%appdata%\NuGet\NuGet.Config```

    macOS: Replace username with your username ```/Users/username/.nuget/NuGet.config```

    Edit the NuGet.config file and add `nuget.local` param, replace `<home_directory>` with your actual path:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <packageSources>
            <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
            <add key="nuget.local" value="<home_directory>/azure-functions-dapr-extension/local-packages" />
        </packageSources>
    </configuration>
    ```

**Preventive Measures:** If you don't need to debug the extension, you should always use [published nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Dapr)

## Dapr sidecar is not present

**Symptoms:** If you are utilizing Dapr bindings and triggers in Azure Functions, you might encounter an error message like the following:

```plaintext
Dapr sidecar is not present. Please see (https://aka.ms/azure-functions-dapr-sidecar-missing) for more information.
```

**Possible Causes:** This error typically occurs when Dapr is not properly enabled in your environment.

**Resolution:**

***Enable Dapr in your application:***

- If your Azure Function is deployed in Azure Container Apps (ACA), refer to the documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-dapr?tabs=in-process%2Cpreview-bundle-v4x%2Cbicep1&pivots=programming-language-python#dapr-enablement) for instructions on enabling Dapr.
- If your Azure Function is deployed in Kubernetes, ensure that your [deployment](https://github.com/ASHIQUEMD/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/kubernetes-deployment.md#sample-kubernetes-deployment) has the following annotations in its YAML configuration:
    ```YAML
    annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "functionapp"
        # Only define port of Dapr triggers are included
        dapr.io/app-port: "3001"
    ```
- If you are running your Azure Function locally, make sure you are [running the function app with Dapr](https://github.com/ASHIQUEMD/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/python-v2-azurefunction#step-2---run-function-app-with-dapr). Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    dapr run --app-id functionapp --app-port 3001  --resources-path ..\components\ -- func host start 
    ```

**Preventive Measures:** To prevent this error, always ensure that Dapr is properly set up and enabled in your environment before using Dapr bindings and triggers with Azure Functions.

## Dapr app config error

**Symptoms:** If you encounter the following error message:
```plaintext
The Dapr sidecar is configured to listen on port {portInt}, but the app server is running on port {appPort}. This may cause unexpected behavior. For more information, visit [this link](https://aka.ms/azfunc-dapr-app-config-error).
```

**Possible Causes:** This error occurs when using Dapr Triggers and not configuring the app port in Dapr settings for the ContainerApps properly. 

**Note:** The Azure Function Dapr Extension starts an HTTP server on port 3001 when there is Dapr trigger in your Azure Function, you can configure this port using the DAPR_APP_PORT environment variable. If you provide an incorrect app_port value when running the Function app, it can lead to this problem.

**Resolution:**

***Configure the app-port correctly:*** In your ContainerApp's Dapr settings,
1. *If you are using a Dapr Trigger in your code*, make sure that the app port is set to 3001 or `DAPR_APP_PORT` if explicitly set as an environment variable for application.
1. *If you are not using a Dapr Trigger in your code*, make sure that the app port is **not set**. It should be empty.

Ensure that you provide the correct DAPR_APP_PORT value to Dapr in the Dapr configuration.

- In Azure Container Apps (ACA), specify it in Bicep as shown below:

```
DaprConfig: {
...
appPort: 3001
...
}
```

- In a Kubernetes environment, set the dapr.io/app-port annotation:


```
annotations:
    ...
    dapr.io/app-port: "3001"
    ...
```

- For local development, make sure to provide --app-port when running the Function app with Dapr:

```
dapr run --app-id functionapp --app-port 3001 --resources-path ..\components\ -- func host start 
```

**Preventive Measures:** To prevent this error, always configure the app-port parameter correctly in your Dapr setup.
